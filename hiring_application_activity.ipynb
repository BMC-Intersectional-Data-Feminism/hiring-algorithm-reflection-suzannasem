    "## Scenario: Moogle’s Hiring Filter\n",
    "Imagine you are working for Moogle, a well-known tech company that receives tens of thousands of job applications from graduating seniors every year. Since the company receives too many job applications for HR to individually assess in a reasonable amount of time, you are asked to create a program that algorithmically analyzes applications and selects the ones most worth passing onto HR.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applicant Data\n",
    "It’s difficult to create these first-pass cuts, so Moogle designs their application forms to get some numerical data about their applicants’ education. Job applicants must enter the grades they received in 6 core CS courses, as well as their overall GPA. For your convenience, this will be stored in a python `list` that you can access. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a student who received the following scores. . .\n",
    "- Intro to CS: 100\n",
    "- Data Structures: 95\n",
    "- Software Engineering: 80\n",
    "- Algorithms: 89\n",
    "- Computer Organization: 91\n",
    "- Operative Systems: 75\n",
    "- Overall GPA: 83\n",
    "\n",
    ". . . would result in the following list: `[100, 95, 80, 89, 91, 75, 83]`. You can assume that index `0` is always Intro to CS, `1` is always Data Structures, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you are processing many applications, your program will receive a list of lists. For example, this would be the information for 3 applicants:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[ [100, 95, 80, 89, 91, 75, 83], [75, 80, 85, 90, 85, 88, 90], [85, 70, 99, 100, 81, 82, 91] ]`"

    "\n",

    "* First, drop the lowest grade and calculate new GPA.\n",
    "* Take weighted average of grades. I prioritized (1) SWE, (2) Algorithms, (3) Computer Organization, and (4) Data structures because these classes seem to relate most directly to industry jobs. I kind of arbitrarily assigned weights, which can be adjusted depending on what skills are prioritized for the role. I also included our new, lowest-grade dropped GPA to factor in overall performance, and required that be above 80%.\n",
    "* I picked the students with highest weighted average of grades, who also have an adjusted GPA > 80. This way we can control how many resumes we look at. The code can be adjusted to give top 10, top 20, top 30, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose this criteria because I thought it gave some grace to candidates by considering a recalculated GPA, but also has the ability to be tailored depending on the role.\n",

    "2. Roughly what percentage of applicants does your algorithm pass on as finalists? Is that enough? If Moogle asked you to take a more aggressive approach with your algorithm, are there any tradeoffs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Only 1 person in the sample set (10%) passed through as a finalist. It might be because of an error in the code, but it also might be because not many students have an adjusted GPA higher than a B. That can be adjusted as needed depending on the applicant pool size.\n",

    "A more aggressive approach would produce fewer applicants for hiring managers to read, with the tradeoff that Moogle may miss out on some incredible candidates because they only consider the highest scoring students. If we can't find a candidate we like from that small pool of high-achieving students, it will also take longer to go back and adjust the algorithm to find more candidates than it would have been to have a large pool from the beginning."

    "Complete the following questions reflecting on these scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What systemic advantages/disadvantages are your algorithms likely to amplify?\n",
    "\n",
    "These kinds of algorithms are giving students from wealthier and more privileged backgrounds an advantage in the hiring process. For example, if a student has lower grades because they have to work to afford their education, they are not considered as highly for the role. There are also student athletes, who spend a lot of time practicing for their sport and don't have as much time to study. Students with learning disabilities or who have trouble taking tests would also get filtered out of this system. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What does it mean to design a fair algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "A fair algorithm is one that does not amplify & tries to mitigate systemic advantages and disadvantages. This is easier said than done. It considers all applicants with their diverse experiences and does not penalize any applicant simply for being from a certain background (including all experiences or lack thereof associated with that background).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If you had access to additional data beyond grades (e.g., extracurricular activities, internships, letters of recommendation), how might you incorporate it into your selection process? Would it make your algorithm fairer or introduce new biases?\n",
    "\n",
    "This would make the algorithm fairer in some ways and more biased in others. For example, by considering extracurriculars, we would be helping students who struggle with test-taking but are highly creative, as wel as student athletes. However, considering internships may be favoring students whose families already work in that field and could help them secure an internship. If we include unpaid internships, that also poses a barrier compared to students who cannot afford to work without pay. Letters of recommendation might help make the process fairer, depending on who it is from. If we require they be from professors, we still may be excluding students whose strengths are not in the classroom.\n",

    "6. How do current hiring filter algorithms work? What problems do they encounter? How do these algorithms broadly compare to the ones we wrote today? (Some example articles discussing hiring filters linked below in citations but you're not limited to these examples) \n",
    "\n",
    "Current hiring filter algorithms consider those who were historically successful applicants (i.e. current and past employees) and determines patterns to screen for new candidates. The issue with this approach is that if a team was mostly men, or mostly graduates from a specific college, or if everyone played a certain sport, then the algorithm will continue to prioritize those applicants who fit that criteria. AI tools take input very literally and will actively discriminate against certain groups if it has bene trained to do so, even if the engineers didn't intend for the AI to be discriminatory. That's why it's so importqnt to address bias before we begin developing algorithms to make sure that as many candidates as possible are fairly considered for the role.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found the article on \"hiring by exploration\" interesting since it considers applicants who have experiences outside of the norm more highly. This can ensure that a company gets a diverse group of employees. I think it's a step in the right direction for developing fairer algorithms, though we should continue to think about what kinds of biases might be hidden in every algorithm.\n"
